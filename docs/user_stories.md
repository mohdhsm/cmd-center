## Overall things I want to do

### Sales information

1. I want to see a list of overdue deals or the deals that are near so I can change the SDD.
2. I want to see a list of stuck deals or problematic so I can send reminders to the owners and know whats the latest summary or if an action has been done to it.
3. I want to see a list of deals that not have been updated in one week, then click on deals to see the notes, and a summary, and ability to send email reminders to the owners.
4. I want to be able to see any deal that have been sitting on the same stage for more than one week.
5. I want to be able to click on any list, and compose an email sending each owner a list of the reminder. And the content of the email should be changing.

1. I want to see a list of deals that are in the following stage in one list along with their value, and latest update (Awaiting Site Readiness, Underprogress, Awaiting GR, Awaiting MDD, Awaiting GCC) grouped by owner with the following column (Name, Value, Stage, Days in Stage, Last update, Last stage change). The whole list should be titled "Deals that are under execution).
